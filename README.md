# BPALab_GuidedProject_23_24
Project documentation of Guided Project in winter 2023

## Part 1: Evaluation of the learning concept 
Learning concept: We would like to investigate the pros and cons of using BPALab hardware components in process automation project with Camunda 8 in the bachelor program.

Your contribution: Please work on the project order in this repository (Project_Order_BicycleManufacturer_V1_1.pdf). As part of this process, please prepare a brief report with answers to the questions below.
This task is not about creating the best technical solution, but to provide comprehensive feedback on the learning concept. At the same time, it is a good warm up exercise for the upcoming work packages.

- How understandable was the project assignment for you? 
- What problems or questions did you encounter while working on the project assignment?
- What requirements would you have for the course materials/documentation? (Please assume you have read the book: Marlon Dumas, Fundamentals of Business Process Management, 2018 as a substitute for the lecture notes).
- What did you learn about business process management systems while working on this project? For which scenarios can a BPMS like Camunda be used?
- How did you feel about using the software component (Open Route) and the hardware component (Fischertechnik robot)? What are pros and cons of involving hardware components?
- What suggestions do you have for improving the project assignment or the teaching concept when using BPA Lab building blocks? 

Please do not hesitate, if you have any questions!!!

## Part 2: Designing and implementing the end to end business process of the Demonstration Factory
Work items will be maintained in the project board of this repository.
